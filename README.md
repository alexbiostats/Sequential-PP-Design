# Sequential-PP-Design
Accompanying R code to replicate simulation results for the "Bayesian and Frequentist approaches to sequential monitoring for futility in oncology
basket trials: A comparison of Simonâ€™s two-stage design and Bayesian predictive probability monitoring with information sharing across baskets" manuscript to appear in *PLOS ONE*. Briefly, Bayesian predictive probabilities (PP) can be used for sequential monitoring in clinical trials. Specifically, in this manuscript, simulation studies of basket trials with 10 one-arm baskets with binary outcomes are implemented. Comparisons are made between Simon's two-stage minimax design, a Bayesian approach with PP for continual futility monitoring, and a Bayesian approach that further considers information sharing across baskets with multi-source exchangeability models (MEMs).
